# Student Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project explores student performance data, including factors such as:
- Parental level of education
- Race/ethnicity
- Test scores in Math, Reading, and Writing
- Gender
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course

The goal is to analyze how different factors affect student performance.


## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data

## Methods
â€¢ Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned with Excel and new columns such as  Average score and Grade were added to the dataset.

â€¢ Data Visualization: Power bi was used as a data visualization tool to better understand the relationship in the dataset and create an interactive dashboard like student performance across gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity.
  
## Tools
1.Microsoft Excel
2.MySql
3.Powerbi

##  Insights & Findings
- The dataset contained a total of 1000 students with the majority being females (518) and males (482).
- Student  whose parents have higher levels of education generally perform better in Math, Reading, and Writing.  
- Female students tend to perform slightly better in Reading and Writing, while male students score higher in Math.  
- Students with access to standard lunch options often perform better than those on free/reduced lunch programs.  
- Race/ethnicity groups show performance differences, suggesting social and cultural factors may influence outcomes.

  ## Recommendations
 1. Ensure access to quality meals for all students, as nutrition is linked to performance.
 2. Provide support and resources for students from lower parental education backgrounds.
 3. Creation of  learning strategies to help address specific subject gaps

    ## Conclusion
This analysis highlights that student success is shaped by multiple factors beyond just classroom teaching. Parental level of  education, test preparation, nutrition, and social groups all play a role. By addressing these factors, schools can create a fairer environment that gives every student the chance to succeed.
